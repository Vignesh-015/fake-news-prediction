According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data_true.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":293},"id":"zmyJYAtNTX0k","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718545659662,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2004,"user":{"displayName":"R.

The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 716,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"September 2, 2017 \",\n          \"February 2, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data_fake[\"class\"]=0\n","data_true[\"class\"]=1"],"metadata":{"id":"-phCBOWYTaxV"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data_fake.shape,data_true.shape"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"NyjrxGXxTnqh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718545729337,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":509,"user":{"displayName":"R.

He met with representatives from the coal industry to sign a bill undoing Obama s coal mining rule. The people s president is a worker!OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON SCOTT PRUITT S APPOINTMENT TO EPA CHIEF THE LEFT WENT BONKERS!OKLAHOMA ATTORNEY GENERAL SCOTT PRUITT is another perfect choice from President-elect Donald Trump. He s sued the feds several times for their overreach in regulations on the coal industry. You have to love his commitment to keeping the federal government on the straight and narrow. It s funny that so many of Trump s picks have gone against Obama s policies We love it! The lefty politicians in DC wasted no time tweeted out their displeasure:When the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rules regulating carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, Scott Pruitt sued. When the Justice Department offered legal status to young undocumented immigrants, Scott Pruitt sued. And when the Obama administration sought to give tax credits to states that hadn t set up their own health insurance exchanges, Scott Pruitt sued.Since becoming Oklahoma attorney general in 2010, Pruitt has filed or joined lawsuits against federal agencies at least a dozen times. Even when Oklahoma isn t an actual party in litigation, the state often submits a legal brief against the federal government. Besides air pollution, immigration and health care, Pruitt has fought federal laws and regulations on banking, contraception and endangered species. These days, whenever states go to court against the Obama administration, the chances are that Pruitt is somehow involved.Not that Pruitt is alone. During Obama s presidency, the entire cadre of Republican attorneys general (27 at present) has coordinated cases against federal agencies at an unprecedented pace. But Pruitt is at the center of the action. He has set up a first-in-the-nation  federalism unit,  which seeks to combat instances of federal overreach by every possible means.Read more: Governing\",\n          \" (In this Oct. 13 story, corrects description of legal standard regarding Trump in paragraph 15) By Alison Frankel and Dan Levine (Reuters) - Donald Trump hasn\\u2019t sued a newspaper for libel in three decades, despite the Republican presidential nominee repeatedly threatening to do so over the course of his business career, according to databases of state and federal court records.  A lawyer for the New York real estate developer demanded on Wednesday The New York Times retract a story in which two women accused Trump of inappropriately touching them. If the newspaper did not comply, Trump, who says the allegations are fabricated, would \\u201cpursue all available actions and remedies,\\u201d the lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said in a letter.  Trump said at a rally on Thursday he was preparing a lawsuit.  An attorney for the Times, David McCraw, said the story was of national importance and the paper would \\u201cwelcome the opportunity\\u201d to defend it in court. Over the years, media outlets including the Wall Street Journal, the Village Voice, the New York Post and Fortune Magazine have reported receiving similar threats from Trump or his representatives in advance of unflattering articles. However, Trump rarely makes good on those threats, according to a Reuters review of court dockets in the database of online legal research service Westlaw, a unit of Thomson Reuters.   \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 The last time he sued a news organization for libel was apparently in 1984. Trump filed the case after the Chicago Tribune\\u2019s architecture critic called his proposed 150-story Manhattan skyscraper an \\u201catrocious, ugly monstrosity.\\u201d In 1985, a federal judge in Manhattan dismissed the suit, ruling the critic had a First Amendment right to express his opinion. The skyscraper was never built. In the 32 years since Trump brought that suit, he has not taken similar action against another news organization, although he or his companies have sued at least three individuals and a book publisher. He was successful in one of those cases.  Book author and former New York Times reporter Timothy O\\u2019Brien defeated a Trump libel lawsuit in 2011, after Trump underwent a grueling deposition by O\\u2019Brien\\u2019s lawyers.  Trump\\u2019s suit against O\\u2019Brien, which also named O\\u2019Brien\\u2019s publisher, Time Warner Book Group, alleged the author deliberately underestimated the businessman\\u2019s net worth. A New Jersey state judge found in 2009 that Trump had not established O\\u2019Brien\\u2019s actual malice. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Former Miss Universe contestant Sheena Monnin was hit with a $5 million default judgment after she failed to appear for arbitration in a case in which Trump claimed she falsely denigrated the pageant as \\u201crigged.\\u201d The arbitration judgment was upheld by a federal judge in Manhattan in 2013. The court record indicates the judgment was paid in 2014. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 The same year, a San Diego federal judge ruled Tarla Makaeff, who was lead plaintiff in a class action against Trump University, did not act with malice when she said in letters to her bank and the Better Business Bureau that Trump University engaged in fraudulent business practices. The judge, Gonzalo Curiel, dismissed Trump\\u2019s defamation claim. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Trump\\u2019s attorneys, as well as a spokeswoman for his campaign, did not respond to requests for comment on his libel litigation record, including requests for information on any suits the Reuters docket search may have missed. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0U.S. courts have routinely deemed Trump a public figure in libel lawsuits. That means he has to show not only that the story is false, but also that the media outlet knew that it was false or published it in \\u201creckless disregard\\u201d for the truth. If Trump were a private person, he would have to show the paper was negligent in failing to learn the allegations were false, which is a lower standard of proof. The New York Times attorney, David McCraw, wrote that the paper carefully vetted the allegations in the story. Any Trump claim will be difficult because Trump\\u2019s accusers were on the record, said Jane Kirtley, a media law expert at University of Minnesota Law School. That would bolster the newspaper\\u2019s argument that it didn\\u2019t act recklessly in publishing their accounts. Trump has vowed to \\u201copen up our libel laws,\\u201d if he wins the presidency on Nov. 8, to make it easier to sue news organizations. In reality, he would not be able to unilaterally change the laws because they are generally governed by individual states and court precedents. Court records show that Trump or his businesses have themselves been sued several times for libel or defamation. Most of those suits, including a complaint by a former tenant of a Trump condominium and another by a former dealer at a Trump casino in Indiana, were dismissed. One defamation suit against Trump survived dismissal, however. Stock analyst Marvin Roffman sued Trump for $2 million in federal court in Philadelphia in 1990, claiming he was fired from his job after publicly predicting the failure of the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City. Roffman alleged Trump defamed him in critical statements to numerous newspapers and magazines. After a federal judge refused to toss the case, the Trump Organization settled in 1991. An attorney for Roffman declined to comment. \",\n          \"MOSCOW (Reuters) - British foreign minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that London could not ignore Russia s meddling in elections around the world, its actions in Ukraine, or the persecution of gay people in Chechnya.

Brandishing an Islamic State flag, masked men in military-style uniforms fired on worshippers at a village mosque on Friday in the worst such bloodshed in modern Egyptian history. It was a dramatic setback for the military, which has been fighting militant groups in the Sinai peninsula for years with air strikes, ground assaults and mass arrests, while hundreds of police and soldiers have been killed. Lacking sufficient counter-insurgency skills, the army began recruiting tribesmen three years ago, hoping their mastery of the Sinai s inhospitable terrain would provide intelligence on the militants and their arms smuggling routes. That campaign has produced limited results and the latest bloodshed will pressure the army to secure better cooperation from tribal leaders despite some gains against Islamic State this year.      No group has claimed responsibility for Friday s assault, whose brutality shocked Egyptians. On Wednesday, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ordered the  military to secure the Sinai within the next three months.  You can use all brute force necessary,  he said. Tribes in the Sinai vowed to unite and join forces with the army after fellow Bedouins were killed in Friday s carnage. But such declarations by Sinai tribes   which accuse the Cairo government of treating them like second-class citizens   have in the past produced limited results. In addition, tribesmen remain divided over feuds and other local issues.  The Egyptian military has more than enough weapons. The biggest issue when it comes to doing anything in the Sinai is to make sure they have good intelligence,  said HA Hellyer, an Egypt expert and senior non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council.  If it is going to be a counter-terrorism, counter-insurgency set of strategies, that will necessitate involvement from the tribes at a very significant level.  Three security and military sources said that over the past two days talks had been held between security officials and tribal leaders in north and central Sinai. Those security officials said greater coordination and cooperation were needed to defeat the militants. The tribes were divided into five groups and security officials sat separately with each group.   We asked them to help us to control the militants in the areas that they live, farm and move in, because each tribe knows its own people best,  said one of the sources.  There are many things that make them cooperate with us and they vary from each tribe to the next. That s why we sat separately with each tribe. One tribe needs services, and there is economic cooperation on projects with another tribe.  A spokesman for the military said it had made no statement on tribal affairs in Sinai and he could not comment Alliances with tribes have succeeded in other countries facing serious extremist threats   under the right conditions.  In 2006, Sunni tribesmen joined forces with U.S. troops in Iraq and rebelled against al Qaeda in what became known as the  Sahwa , or Awakening.  By January 2009, Washington had invested more than $400 million in the Awakening program, according to U.S. data. Fighters were paid as much as $300-400 a month.  That investment paid off, helping Iraqi security forces to defeat al Qaeda then.  Under a Sisi initiative in 2015 to reinforce cooperation, several hundred Bedouins were to be recruited. Occasionally, they joined patrols and manned checkpoints under supervision. But some tribal leaders were reluctant to team up with the army without more weapons to confront battle-hardened militant fighters. Authorities are wary of supplying arms to tribes with a history of animosity to Cairo, security officials say.  When the security officials spoke to the tribal leaders, they told them that there is no third option in front of them. Either with us or against us,  another source said.   Most of the tribes immediately announced their cooperation with security forces, and others asked for some time to think. But I think that the security forces don t have the time to give them to think.  Mustafa al-Aqili, of the Supreme Council of Arab Tribes, said heavy losses in the mosque attack could encourage both sides to work more closely together. But he stressed waging war against radicals was the responsibility of the military.   Sinai s people grew stronger after that attack and they are standing more with the army,  he said.  They are keen to join the fighting. But that is the job of the army.  A security source in El-Arish, the main city in North Sinai, said ties have improved.   The Bedouins are cooperating with us and have increased their cooperation,  he said. Bringing Sinai s tribes together and on the military s side will not be easy. The cash-strapped government would have to create jobs and invest in schools and infrastructure. To appease angry residents for now, authorities announced $10 million in funds shortly after the attack.  We have no relationship with politics or anything else, and don t cooperate with the army or armed groups,  said Mansur Eid, who lost his son in Friday s attack.  We just live in poverty here.  Egypt may face a bigger challenge if Islamic State militants defeated in Iraq, Syria and Libya join comrades in the Sinai. Help from tribes would be even more important. Friday s attack was similar to Islamic State s approach in Iraq, where it has bombed places of worship in a bid to deepen sectarian strife. Sisi has said that fighters returning from Iraq and Syria may seek refuge in Libya and target Egypt from there.   In his most recent speech released in September, Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi urged followers in North Sinai to keep fighting after the group was defeated in Mosul.  Tribal leaders say there are around 800 militants, mostly Egyptians, with some Palestinians and other foreigners, in the North Sinai. But even small numbers of fighters have inflicted heavy casualties with suicide bombings in Egypt and elsewhere. Islamic State is also seeking to enlist tribesmen in the Sinai, and Ahmed Zagloul, a researcher on Islamist movements, said it had managed to recruit from the largest tribes. By capitalizing on frustrations with the government and civilian deaths, Islamic State has won some support despite its brutal methods. Many in the Sinai were not won over by the government s methods of fighting terrorism, which had left some villages completely destroyed, said Sheikh Ibrahim al-Menei, a leader of the Sawarka tribe. \",\n          \"Donald Trump s presidential campaign appears to be very worried about the prospect that a third-party campaign could eat into his votes, delivering the election victory to Hillary Clinton.Conservative writer and activist Bill Kristol has been trying to recruit a candidate to run against Trump and Clinton, for those on the right who have aligned themselves with the  #NeverTrump  movement. The #NeverTrump crowd opposes Trump s campaign but can t bring themselves to support the Democratic nominee. Kristol recently tried to stir up support for writer David French to get on the ballot, and that s when Team Trump freaked out.It was enough, apparently, to spook the Trump campaign. Sources say that on Wednesday, influential supporters of the campaign, prompted by the campaign itself, began reaching out to the Republican National Committee, to Kristol, and to French attempting to quash the bid. One Trump operative reached French s wife s family in Tennessee and told them, according to French, that he was  instructed to call and deliver a message that the race would be very difficult for me.   It was a pretty big assault that really put pressure on David that this not happen,  says a source familiar with the communications.As recent stories have indicated, it is highly likely that this thuggish maneuver came directly from Trump himself at the top. He has shown an intense interest in micromanaging his campaign, while at the same time a paranoia about anyone who would oppose him (he recently speculated that his phone may be bugged).Eventually, French decided not to run, and #NeverTrump continues to flail as the Republican establishment backs Trump even with his insistence on running a racist presidential campaign.But now it is known that if someone decides to challenge Trump, especially directly from the right in a way that could hurt his already problematic campaign, he won t hesitate to reach out to their families for some old fashioned intimidation.Featured image via YouTube\",\n          \"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said she spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday about Rohingya Muslims flooding into her country from Myanmar, but she expects no help from him as he has made clear how he feels about refugees. As Trump left an event he hosted at the United Nations on reforming the world body, Hasina said she stopped him for a few minutes.  He just asked how is Bangladesh? I said  it s doing very well, but the only problem that we have is the refugees from Myanmar ,  Hasina told Reuters in an interview.  But he didn t make any comment about refugees.  A Myanmar military response to insurgent attacks last month in the country s Rakhine state sent more than 410,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh, escaping what the United Nations has branded as ethnic cleansing. The Myanmar government says about 400 people have been killed in the fighting.  Hasina, who is due to address the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday, said Trump s stance on refugees was clear, so it was not worth asking him for help with the Rohingya Muslim refugees.   Already America declared that they will not allow any refugees,  she said.  What I can expect from them, and especially (the) president. He already declared his mind ... so why I should ask?   Bangladesh is not a rich country ... but if we can feed 160 million people, another 500 or 700,000 people, we can do it.  A senior White House official was unaware of the exchange but said Trump was deeply interested in the subject and that  he would definitely engage if it were brought up.  Shortly after taking office in January, Trump tried to put a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program, bar Syrian refugees indefinitely and impose a 90-day suspension on people from six predominantly Muslim countries.    The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!  Trump said on Twitter on Friday.  Trump says the move is needed to prevent terrorist attacks and allow the government to put in place more stringent vetting procedures. There is a key Supreme Court hearing next month on the constitutionality of his executive order on the ban. About a million Rohingya lived in Rakhine State until the recent violence. Most face travel restrictions and are denied citizenship in a country where many Buddhists regard them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.  Hasina said she wanted to see more international political pressure on Myanmar to allow the Rohingya to return.   (Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi) should agree that these people belong to her country and that Myanmar is their country. They should take them back,  she said.  These people are suffering.  Nobel laureate Suu Kyi has faced a barrage of international criticism for not stopping the violence. Myanmar national security adviser Thaung Tun told Reuters on Monday that Myanmar would ensure those who left their homes could return, but there was  a process we have to discuss.  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley urged the Myanmar government to end military operations, grant humanitarian access, and commit to aiding the safe return of civilians to their homes.  People are still at risk of being attacked or killed, humanitarian aid is not reaching the people who need it, and innocent civilians are still fleeing across the border to Bangladesh,  Haley said after Britain hosted a meeting on the crisis in New York on Monday. A U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state, Patrick Murphy, is due in Myanmar this week. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":17}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data.reset_index(inplace =True)\n","data.drop(['index'],axis=1,inplace=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"mT7nSBdjWQu9"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data.columns"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"1UW5hYiFWcOD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718546461612,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":523,"user":{"displayName":"R.

Brandishing an Islamic State flag, masked men in military-style uniforms fired on worshippers at a village mosque on Friday in the worst such bloodshed in modern Egyptian history. It was a dramatic setback for the military, which has been fighting militant groups in the Sinai peninsula for years with air strikes, ground assaults and mass arrests, while hundreds of police and soldiers have been killed. Lacking sufficient counter-insurgency skills, the army began recruiting tribesmen three years ago, hoping their mastery of the Sinai s inhospitable terrain would provide intelligence on the militants and their arms smuggling routes. That campaign has produced limited results and the latest bloodshed will pressure the army to secure better cooperation from tribal leaders despite some gains against Islamic State this year.      No group has claimed responsibility for Friday s assault, whose brutality shocked Egyptians. On Wednesday, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ordered the  military to secure the Sinai within the next three months.  You can use all brute force necessary,  he said. Tribes in the Sinai vowed to unite and join forces with the army after fellow Bedouins were killed in Friday s carnage. But such declarations by Sinai tribes   which accuse the Cairo government of treating them like second-class citizens   have in the past produced limited results. In addition, tribesmen remain divided over feuds and other local issues.  The Egyptian military has more than enough weapons. The biggest issue when it comes to doing anything in the Sinai is to make sure they have good intelligence,  said HA Hellyer, an Egypt expert and senior non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council.  If it is going to be a counter-terrorism, counter-insurgency set of strategies, that will necessitate involvement from the tribes at a very significant level.  Three security and military sources said that over the past two days talks had been held between security officials and tribal leaders in north and central Sinai. Those security officials said greater coordination and cooperation were needed to defeat the militants. The tribes were divided into five groups and security officials sat separately with each group.   We asked them to help us to control the militants in the areas that they live, farm and move in, because each tribe knows its own people best,  said one of the sources.  There are many things that make them cooperate with us and they vary from each tribe to the next. That s why we sat separately with each tribe. One tribe needs services, and there is economic cooperation on projects with another tribe.  A spokesman for the military said it had made no statement on tribal affairs in Sinai and he could not comment Alliances with tribes have succeeded in other countries facing serious extremist threats   under the right conditions.  In 2006, Sunni tribesmen joined forces with U.S. troops in Iraq and rebelled against al Qaeda in what became known as the  Sahwa , or Awakening.  By January 2009, Washington had invested more than $400 million in the Awakening program, according to U.S. data. Fighters were paid as much as $300-400 a month.  That investment paid off, helping Iraqi security forces to defeat al Qaeda then.  Under a Sisi initiative in 2015 to reinforce cooperation, several hundred Bedouins were to be recruited. Occasionally, they joined patrols and manned checkpoints under supervision. But some tribal leaders were reluctant to team up with the army without more weapons to confront battle-hardened militant fighters. Authorities are wary of supplying arms to tribes with a history of animosity to Cairo, security officials say.  When the security officials spoke to the tribal leaders, they told them that there is no third option in front of them. Either with us or against us,  another source said.   Most of the tribes immediately announced their cooperation with security forces, and others asked for some time to think. But I think that the security forces don t have the time to give them to think.  Mustafa al-Aqili, of the Supreme Council of Arab Tribes, said heavy losses in the mosque attack could encourage both sides to work more closely together. But he stressed waging war against radicals was the responsibility of the military.   Sinai s people grew stronger after that attack and they are standing more with the army,  he said.  They are keen to join the fighting. But that is the job of the army.  A security source in El-Arish, the main city in North Sinai, said ties have improved.   The Bedouins are cooperating with us and have increased their cooperation,  he said. Bringing Sinai s tribes together and on the military s side will not be easy. The cash-strapped government would have to create jobs and invest in schools and infrastructure. To appease angry residents for now, authorities announced $10 million in funds shortly after the attack.  We have no relationship with politics or anything else, and don t cooperate with the army or armed groups,  said Mansur Eid, who lost his son in Friday s attack.  We just live in poverty here.  Egypt may face a bigger challenge if Islamic State militants defeated in Iraq, Syria and Libya join comrades in the Sinai. Help from tribes would be even more important. Friday s attack was similar to Islamic State s approach in Iraq, where it has bombed places of worship in a bid to deepen sectarian strife. Sisi has said that fighters returning from Iraq and Syria may seek refuge in Libya and target Egypt from there.   In his most recent speech released in September, Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi urged followers in North Sinai to keep fighting after the group was defeated in Mosul.  Tribal leaders say there are around 800 militants, mostly Egyptians, with some Palestinians and other foreigners, in the North Sinai. But even small numbers of fighters have inflicted heavy casualties with suicide bombings in Egypt and elsewhere. Islamic State is also seeking to enlist tribesmen in the Sinai, and Ahmed Zagloul, a researcher on Islamist movements, said it had managed to recruit from the largest tribes. By capitalizing on frustrations with the government and civilian deaths, Islamic State has won some support despite its brutal methods. Many in the Sinai were not won over by the government s methods of fighting terrorism, which had left some villages completely destroyed, said Sheikh Ibrahim al-Menei, a leader of the Sawarka tribe. \",\n          \"Donald Trump s presidential campaign appears to be very worried about the prospect that a third-party campaign could eat into his votes, delivering the election victory to Hillary Clinton.Conservative writer and activist Bill Kristol has been trying to recruit a candidate to run against Trump and Clinton, for those on the right who have aligned themselves with the  #NeverTrump  movement. The #NeverTrump crowd opposes Trump s campaign but can t bring themselves to support the Democratic nominee. Kristol recently tried to stir up support for writer David French to get on the ballot, and that s when Team Trump freaked out.It was enough, apparently, to spook the Trump campaign. Sources say that on Wednesday, influential supporters of the campaign, prompted by the campaign itself, began reaching out to the Republican National Committee, to Kristol, and to French attempting to quash the bid. One Trump operative reached French s wife s family in Tennessee and told them, according to French, that he was  instructed to call and deliver a message that the race would be very difficult for me.   It was a pretty big assault that really put pressure on David that this not happen,  says a source familiar with the communications.As recent stories have indicated, it is highly likely that this thuggish maneuver came directly from Trump himself at the top. He has shown an intense interest in micromanaging his campaign, while at the same time a paranoia about anyone who would oppose him (he recently speculated that his phone may be bugged).Eventually, French decided not to run, and #NeverTrump continues to flail as the Republican establishment backs Trump even with his insistence on running a racist presidential campaign.But now it is known that if someone decides to challenge Trump, especially directly from the right in a way that could hurt his already problematic campaign, he won t hesitate to reach out to their families for some old fashioned intimidation.Featured image via YouTube\",\n          \"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said she spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday about Rohingya Muslims flooding into her country from Myanmar, but she expects no help from him as he has made clear how he feels about refugees. As Trump left an event he hosted at the United Nations on reforming the world body, Hasina said she stopped him for a few minutes.  He just asked how is Bangladesh? I said  it s doing very well, but the only problem that we have is the refugees from Myanmar ,  Hasina told Reuters in an interview.  But he didn t make any comment about refugees.  A Myanmar military response to insurgent attacks last month in the country s Rakhine state sent more than 410,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh, escaping what the United Nations has branded as ethnic cleansing. The Myanmar government says about 400 people have been killed in the fighting.  Hasina, who is due to address the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday, said Trump s stance on refugees was clear, so it was not worth asking him for help with the Rohingya Muslim refugees.   Already America declared that they will not allow any refugees,  she said.  What I can expect from them, and especially (the) president. He already declared his mind ... so why I should ask?   Bangladesh is not a rich country ... but if we can feed 160 million people, another 500 or 700,000 people, we can do it.  A senior White House official was unaware of the exchange but said Trump was deeply interested in the subject and that  he would definitely engage if it were brought up.  Shortly after taking office in January, Trump tried to put a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program, bar Syrian refugees indefinitely and impose a 90-day suspension on people from six predominantly Muslim countries.    The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!  Trump said on Twitter on Friday.  Trump says the move is needed to prevent terrorist attacks and allow the government to put in place more stringent vetting procedures. There is a key Supreme Court hearing next month on the constitutionality of his executive order on the ban. About a million Rohingya lived in Rakhine State until the recent violence. Most face travel restrictions and are denied citizenship in a country where many Buddhists regard them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.  Hasina said she wanted to see more international political pressure on Myanmar to allow the Rohingya to return.   (Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi) should agree that these people belong to her country and that Myanmar is their country. They should take them back,  she said.  These people are suffering.  Nobel laureate Suu Kyi has faced a barrage of international criticism for not stopping the violence. Myanmar national security adviser Thaung Tun told Reuters on Monday that Myanmar would ensure those who left their homes could return, but there was  a process we have to discuss.  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley urged the Myanmar government to end military operations, grant humanitarian access, and commit to aiding the safe return of civilians to their homes.  People are still at risk of being attacked or killed, humanitarian aid is not reaching the people who need it, and innocent civilians are still fleeing across the border to Bangladesh,  Haley said after Britain hosted a meeting on the crisis in New York on Monday. A U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state, Patrick Murphy, is due in Myanmar this week. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":20}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def wordopt(text):\n","  text = text.lower()\n","  text = re.sub('\\[.*?\\]', '', text)\n","  text = re.sub(\"\\\\W\", \" \", text)\n","  text = re.sub('https?://\\S+|www\\.\\S+', '', text)\n","  text = re.sub('<.*?>+', '', text)\n","  text = re.sub('[%s]' %re.escape(string.punctuation), '', text)\n","  text = re.sub('\\n', '', text)\n","  text = re.sub('\\w*\\d\\w*', '', text)\n","  return text"],"metadata":{"id":"3a7LjsQMWhwf"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data['text'] = data['text'].apply(wordopt)"],"metadata":{"id":"8PoTOv1WXnCj"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["x=data['text']\n","y=data['class']"],"metadata":{"id":"2MZ0FHVBXu6h"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test =  train_test_split(x,y,test_size=0.25)"],"metadata":{"id":"Sd4VbEEyZGFz"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n","\n","vectorization = TfidfVectorizer()\n","xv_train =vectorization.fit_transform(x_train)\n","xv_test  = vectorization.transform(x_test)"],"metadata":{"id":"Vgspv1j6ZZIW"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","LR = LogisticRegression()\n","LR.fit(xv_train, y_train)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":74},"id":"XrLfFCQAZ10B","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718547477964,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":11216,"user":{"displayName":"R.

Now, we have another case that needs to be shared far and wide. An Alabama woman by the name of Angela Williams shared a graphic photo of her son, lying in a hospital bed with a beaten and fractured face, on Facebook. It needs to be shared far and wide, because this is unacceptable.It is unclear why Williams  son was in police custody or what sort of altercation resulted in his arrest, but when you see the photo you will realize that these details matter not. Cops are not supposed to beat and brutalize those in their custody. In the post you are about to see, Ms. Williams expresses her hope that the cops had their body cameras on while they were beating her son, but I think we all know that there will be some kind of convenient  malfunction  to explain away the lack of existence of dash or body camera footage of what was clearly a brutal beating. Hell, it could even be described as attempted murder. Something tells me that this young man will never be the same. Without further ado, here is what Troy, Alabama s finest decided was appropriate treatment of Angela Williams  son:No matter what the perceived crime of this young man might be, this is completely unacceptable. The cops who did this need to rot in jail for a long, long time   but what you wanna bet they get a paid vacation while the force  investigates  itself, only to have the officers returned to duty posthaste?This, folks, is why we say BLACK LIVES MATTER. No way in hell would this have happened if Angela Williams  son had been white.

Jones won the vacant seat by about 22,000 votes, or 1.6 percentage points, election officials said. That made him the first Democrat in a quarter of a century to win a Senate seat in Alabama.  The seat was previously held by Republican Jeff Sessions, who was tapped by U.S. President Donald Trump as attorney general. A state canvassing board composed of Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, Governor Kay Ivey and Attorney General Steve Marshall certified the election results. Seating Jones will narrow the Republican majority in the Senate to 51 of 100 seats. In a statement, Jones called his victory â€œa new chapterâ€ and pledged to work with both parties. Moore declined to concede defeat even after Trump urged him to do so. He stood by claims of a fraudulent election in a statement released after the certification and said he had no regrets, media outlets reported. An Alabama judge denied Mooreâ€™s request to block certification of the results of the Dec. 12 election in a decision shortly before the canvassing board met. Mooreâ€™s challenge alleged there had been potential voter fraud that denied him a chance of victory. His filing on Wednesday in the Montgomery Circuit Court sought to halt the meeting scheduled to ratify Jonesâ€™ win on Thursday. Moore could ask for a recount, in addition to possible other court challenges, Merrill said in an interview with Fox News Channel. He would have to complete paperwork â€œwithin a timed periodâ€ and show he has the money for a challenge, Merrill said. â€œWeâ€™ve not been notified yet of their intention to do that,â€ Merrill said. Regarding the claim of voter fraud, Merrill told CNN that more than 100 cases had been reported. â€œWeâ€™ve adjudicated more than 60 of those. We will continue to do that,â€ he said.  Republican lawmakers in Washington had distanced themselves from Moore and called for him to drop out of the race after several women accused him of sexual assault or misconduct dating back to when they were teenagers and he was in his early 30s.  Moore has denied wrongdoing and Reuters has not been able to independently verify the allegations. \n","\n","\n","LR Prediction: Not A Fake News \n","DT Prediction: Not A Fake News \n","GB Prediction: Not A Fake News \n","RF Prediction: Not A Fake News\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["news=str(input())\n","manual_testing(news)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"RANW3HutsTtg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718552280801,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":29861,"user":{"displayName":"R.

He has been accused of molesting young girls as young as age fourteen. Of course, when the allegations first came out and the uproar and backlash began, everyone, regardless of politics, reacted with outrage. However, the GOP s outrage was often much more muted. Further, it took awhile for the Republican National Committee to pull their support for Moore, despite the deeply disturbing allegations of his being a pedophile. Well, now that the rage has died down, the RNC is back with a new message regarding this Senate race: Better a pedophile than a Democrat.Under cover of night, the RNC reinstated their support for Roy Moore, and an RNC official confirmed to The Hill that, quote, We can confirm our involvement in the Alabama Senate race. So, there you have it, folks. They literally want a child molester in the United States Senate rather than a Democrat. There are only a few voices from the right who are being brave on this one   and none of them are seeking re-election. Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney tweeted that the GOP must not tolerate Moore:Roy Moore in the US Senate would be a stain on the GOP and on the nation. Leigh Corfman and other victims are courageous heroes. No vote, no majority is worth losing our honor, our integrity.  Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) December 4, 2017Outgoing Arizona GOP Senator Jeff Flake has actually said that he would vote for the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, if he lived in Alabama, and former Jeb Bush adviser Tim Miller has actually endorsed and donated to Jones. Outgoing Pennsylvania moderate Republican Charlie Dent said he never supported Moore in the first place. Here s the video of Dent s takedown of Moore:There is also outspoken Trump critic and longtime GOP strategist Steve Schmidt, who went on national television and called Moore a pedophile:Other than that, though, it has been radio silence. After all, they need that vote. Besides, let s face it   the GOP writ large showed America and the world what they stand for when they elected Donald Trump.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images\n","\n","\n","LR Prediction: Fake News \n","DT Prediction: Fake News \n","GB Prediction: Fake News \n","RF Prediction: Fake News\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["news=str(input())\n","manual_testing(news)"],"metadata":{"id":"WDiZZ4xRukzA","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718553655211,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":27120,"user":{"displayName":"R.
